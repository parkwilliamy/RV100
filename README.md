# R500
## Features
- R500 is a 32-bit processor based on the RISC-V architecture
- R500 has a CPI of 1.23, branch predictor accuracy of 96.5%, and a throughput of 46.3 million instructions per second
- Implemented on the Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA with 20KB of instruction memory and 12KB of data memory
- Utilizes a 5-stage pipeline with global branch prediction
- Designed a 2-way set associative branch target buffer to eliminate penalties for taken branch instructions
